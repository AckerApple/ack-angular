  p In the past, I've had large AngularJs (ng1) apps that loaded seemingly instantly. Without Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compiling, Angular2 takes seconds to load in browser. When applying AoT compiling, Angular2 certainly loads faster. I depend on @angular/compiler-cli (ngc) to compile AoT and it has "limitations" that make the whole process a bit more complicated.
