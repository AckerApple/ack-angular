# Install

```bash
npm install --save-dev web-animations-js ack-x ack-angular-fx ack-angular
```

## Importing into Project
ack-angular uses file based imports, importing the index does nothing.

### Import Samples

#### Various Import Examples
```javascript
import { pipes, components } from "ack-angular"

//save as above
import { declarations as pipes } from "ack-angular/pipes"
import { declarations as components } from "ack-angular/declarations"
```

#### Dependency Based Import Examples
If you attempt to import any of the following, certain dependencies must have already been installed.

[check dependency map](#dependency-map)

```javascript
//requires @angular/router imports
import { RouteReporter } from "ack-angular/RouteReporter.directive"
import { RouteWatchReporter } from "ack-angular/RouteWatchReporter"
```

## Dependency Map
If you import the following files, make sure you have installed it's dependencies

> You can ignore all of this if you used [ack-webpack to install jsDependencies](#ack-webpack-install-jsdependencies)

- ack-angular/**RouteReporter.directive.ts**
  - Import Example : `import { RouteReporter } from "ack-angular/RouteReporter.directive"`
  - Dependency Install `npm install @angular/router --save-dev`
- ack-angular/**RouteWatchReporter.ts**
  - Import Example : `import { RouteWatchReporter } from "ack-angular/RouteWatchReporter"`
  - Dependency Install `npm install @angular/router --save-dev`

> The [Extended Documentation](https://ackerapple.github.io/ack-angular/) may help bring further understanding as to what is required and when to import dependencies

# Components
Directives and Components making development life more joyful

## Common Components
Include one file and access several

```javascript
import { pipes as ackPipes , components as ackComps } from "ack-angular/declarations";
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

@NgModule({
  declarations:[...ackComps, ...ackPipes]
})
```

## Complex Components
Components that have additional dependencies or restrictions

### route-reporter
A directive that exposes @angular/router metadata for use in a component template
```javascript
import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { RouteWatchReporter } from "ack-angular/RouteWatchReporter"
import { RouteReporter } from "ack-angular/RouteReporter.directive"
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

@NgModule({
  imports:[ RouterModule.forRoot([], {}) ],
  providers: [ UiRouteWatchReporter ],
  declarations:[ UiRouteReporter ]
})
```
